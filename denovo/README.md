# De Novo Drug Design of Serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) Receptor

In this tutorial, we will try to use different tools to automatically generate theoretical structures of novel 5-HT1A ligands. We will use a pretrained QSAR model for optimization of the predicted structures using two distinct strategies, CReM-ML and DrugEx.

## DrugEx

TODO: some intro

You will use the DrugEx pretrained models and other data in this tutorial, which you can download with the following command:

```bash
drugex download # execute in current directory
````

You can start the tutorial by following the [drugex](./drugex.ipynb) notebook.
